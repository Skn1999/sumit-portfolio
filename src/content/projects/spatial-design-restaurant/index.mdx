## Setting the Scene

Täffä is more than a student-run lunch restaurant in Otaniemi — it is a social node where students gather, decompress, and share time between studies.  
Our team set out to understand how the space either enables or restricts social interaction during busy campus hours.

To uncover this, we conducted **contextual inquiry**, **on-site observations**, and **interviews** to reveal Täffä’s hidden social dynamics and spatial cues.

## 01 — Understanding the Space

Täffä welcomes a diverse group of users:  
regular visitors, newcomers, groups of friends, and students rushing between lectures.

Our initial visits surfaced four recurring challenges:

- **Fluctuating noise levels**  
- **Limited intimate seating options**  
- **Cultural ambiguity for newcomers**  
- **Functional but emotionally “flat” spatial layout**

By documenting behaviours, comfort levels, and natural interaction patterns, we established a clear baseline for the user experience.

## 02 — User Investigations

We interviewed students during both peak and off-peak hours to understand motivations, frustrations, and social behaviours.

A recurring insight was difficulty maintaining conversations:

> “Sometimes it might be hard to hear… you really have to lean into the conversation.”

At the same time, students praised the **terrace**, the **quality of food**, and the spaciousness that accommodates groups.

## 03 — From Data Chaos to Information Order

We synthesised our research through affinity mapping and uncovered four thematic pillars:

- **Acoustics** — interruptions in conversation flow  
- **Seating Comfort** — desire for relaxed, intimate spots  
- **Cultural Openness** — uncertainty among newcomers about “how things work”  
- **Group Accommodation** — appreciation for the restaurant’s spaciousness  

This process helped us recognise the emotional nuances behind spatial behaviours.

## 04 — Persona Development

From recurring behavioural patterns, three personas emerged:

- **Sam - The Midday Fueler**  
- **Liisa - The Socializer**  
- **Miika - The Busy Bee**

We selected **Liisa** as the focal persona.  
Her need for comfort, intimacy, and smooth social interaction highlighted universal opportunities for all user groups.

## 05 — Key Pain Points

### **Noise + Disruption**  
Acoustic clutter frequently made conversations difficult.

### **Limited Intimate Corners**  
Students preferred side tables to avoid sitting too close to strangers.

### **Cultural Barriers**  
Newcomers often felt unsure of social norms within the space.

### **Uncomfortable Furniture**  
Hard seating discouraged longer, more relaxed conversations.

## 06 — Identifying Opportunities

Based on our insights, we reframed opportunities into actionable directions:

- Introduce spatial cues that support **small-group intimacy**  
- Explore materials or layouts that **soften acoustic noise**  
- Add environmental communication to help **orient newcomers**  
- Revisit furniture choices to **increase comfort** and encourage lingering


## 07 — How Might We…

> **How might we design Täffä to better support social interaction and meaningful connections?**

This question became the guiding principle for our concept development phase.
