## Overview

This project focused on improving **social integration and shared living experiences** in Chilean social housing developments. The goal was to explore how **participatory design methods** can empower residents to co-create solutions that foster belonging, collaboration, and mutual support within their communities.

## My Role

I led the **research and facilitation** of participatory workshops with residents, local stakeholders, and design students. My responsibilities included defining research goals, planning co-design activities, synthesizing insights, and visualizing design outcomes using **Figma** and **Miro**.

## Process

The design process followed a **user-centered and participatory framework**, structured around three stages:

1. **Contextual Research** – Conducted ethnographic observations and semi-structured interviews to understand residents’ daily routines, shared space usage, and social barriers.
2. **Co-Design Workshops** – Facilitated ideation sessions where residents reimagined their shared spaces through storytelling, sketching, and collaborative mapping.
3. **Synthesis & Prototyping** – Clustered insights into themes of _safety, inclusion, and shared identity_, leading to concept proposals for spatial and programmatic interventions that encourage community engagement.

## Outcome

The project resulted in actionable design guidelines and spatial concepts that enhanced the usability of shared areas and **strengthened residents’ sense of ownership**. Through active participation, residents reported **higher engagement and a stronger perception of community belonging**.

## Reflection

This project deepened my understanding of **design as a social mediator** — not just a problem-solving tool. It reinforced the value of empathy, inclusion, and co-creation in shaping design solutions that have real human and cultural impact.
