## Overview

You move into a new apartment. There's a courtyard downstairs, a couple of benches, a patch of grass. On paper it's a "common area." In practice, nobody uses it. The kids from the subsidized units play on one side. The families who bought at market price stay on the other. Everyone nods politely and goes inside.

That gap, between a space that *exists* and a space that *belongs to people*, is what this project is about.

Mesa Te Club is a participatory design framework that turns awkward shared spaces in Chilean social housing into places people actually want to be in. Not by handing residents a finished blueprint, but by sitting them down with tea, snacks, and a set of playful tools and letting them design the spaces themselves, alongside developers, municipalities, and the housing ministry.

> _I led workshop design, research synthesis, and co-design tool creation across the full DS19 project timeline._

## The problem nobody was designing for

Chile has a housing program called DS19. On the surface, it's progressive, that is, private developers must reserve a percentage of units for vulnerable families, mixed in with market-rate buyers. The idea is reducing the socio-economic segregation that happens between people living in the same building.

But here's what actually happens:

    <strong className="block">A missed opportunity</strong>
    <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mt-1 leading-relaxed">DS19 already has a practice called "Mesa Te Club" — tea gatherings for communication. But they're used to talk at people, not with them.</p>
  </article>
</section>

That last one is what changed everything for me. There was already a table. Already tea. Already a name. What if we turned that table into a design studio?

> What if the common areas of social housing were co-designed by the people who will actually live there, through something as simple as sharing tea?

## How I got there

### 1. Mapping the ecosystem

Before designing anything, I needed to understand the forces at play. DS19 isn't just residents and architects, it's a system of different actors with different interests and unequal power dynamics.

I mapped four key actors and what drives (and blocks) each one:

<section className="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-3 my-6 not-prose">
  <article className="bg-muted rounded-xl p-5 border border-border/10">
    <strong>🏛️ Housing Ministry</strong>
    <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mt-1 leading-relaxed">Sets guidelines, balances budget with integration goals. Interested in better outcomes but distant from residents' everyday life.</p>
  </article>
  <article className="bg-muted rounded-xl p-5 border border-border/10">
    <strong>🏘️ Municipalities</strong>
    <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mt-1 leading-relaxed">Closest to urban challenges. Genuinely want better tools to support residents, but lack resources and design methods.</p>
  </article>
  <article className="bg-muted rounded-xl p-5 border border-border/10">
    <strong>🏢 Developers</strong>
    <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mt-1 leading-relaxed">Experts in construction and cost. Reluctant to take on "social" responsibilities or hand future residents any design power.</p>
  </article>
  <article className="bg-muted rounded-xl p-5 border border-border/10">
    <strong>👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Residents</strong>
    <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mt-1 leading-relaxed">Seeking affordable housing, safe spaces for children, places for community. They have the most at stake and the least say.</p>
  </article>
</section>

The pattern was clear: everyone wanted better common areas, but nobody had a process for designing them *together*. The system was stuck in a loop of top-down decisions and bottom-up frustration.

---

### 2. The reframe that unlocked everything

The original brief was broad: "design a participatory process for DS19 common areas." That could mean anything. Workshops, surveys, apps, committees.

But when I looked at what already existed — the Mesa Te Club tea gatherings — I realized I didn't need to invent a new format. I needed to **redesign an existing one**.

> Mesa Te Club was already a ritual. It had trust, familiarity, a name. All it needed was design power.

---

## What I designed

### A participation ladder, disguised as tea time

The framework has six activities, each designed for a different moment and a different kind of input. Together, they form a ladder — from early idea crowdsourcing to post-occupancy learning.

---

### Tree of Dreams — surfacing what people hope for

Before any design happens, we need to know what people care about. "Tree of Dreams" is a low-barrier activity. Residents attach notes to a physical tree in the sales room or contribute digitally, sharing what they wish for in their future home and shared spaces.

Safety. Nature. A place for kids to play. Somewhere to sit and read. A garden.

The goal here isn't consensus but to understand the variety of needs of the residents.

{/* TODO: Add image — Tree of Dreams activity, physical tree with notes attached */}

---

### Build-A-Space Lab — translating dreams into requirements

Once we have a rich picture of needs, I designed a 2.5-hour expert workshop. Architects, planners, municipal social workers, and developers sit together and work through a **Common Area Canvas** I created.

They collaboratively define components (play, sport, relax, nature, culture), constraints (cost, maintenance, geography), and how each element supports social integration. The output is a set of clear requirements but grounded in feasibility.

> This is where dreams meet reality. But the point isn't to kill dreams — it's to make them buildable.

### Playing Sims — residents design the layout

This is the heart of the project. A 2-hour Mesa Te Club session where groups of residents receive a blank plan of their future building with highlighted common areas, and a set of **pre-priced modular pieces** — playground, benches, gardens, courts, a barbecue area.

Each group negotiates how to fill the plan within spatial and budget constraints. Then everyone votes on their favorite configuration using stickers. For example, if someone votes for a bigger playground, they have to vote against a garden or a seating area. The trade-offs become visible, and priorities become shared.

---

### Design Reveal — closing the loop

After integrating expert and resident inputs, I designed a "Design Reveal" moment. Through email, website, and WhatsApp, residents see the final chosen common areas, what was possible, what wasn't, and why.

This step is about managing expectations and reinforcing that **participation led to concrete outcomes**. People gave input. The design reflects it. Here's the proof.

<ProjectImageAsset src="social-integration-pd/design-reveal.png" alt="Description" />

---

### "Never Have I Ever" — learning after move-in

Months after delivery, residents, administrators and developers sit in the built common areas and play a custom version of "Never Have I Ever." Cards prompt stories about safety, events, maintenance, and inclusivity. Designated note-takers capture insights.

The session closes the feedback loop of "what we designed, how it's actually being used, and what the next building should do differently". 

> The most important design moment isn't the workshop. It's six months after everyone moves in.

## How it all fits together

Every activity is intentionally alignedwith the DS19 Social Integration Plan's two year horizon:

  </article>
</section>

Mesa Te Club isn't a one-off event. It's a **recurring rhythm** — the same table, the same format, appearing at every decision point across the project lifecycle.

## What came out of it

The proposal was developed as part of a design-for-social-change studio, so the main output is a deployable framework rather than a built pilot. But through iterative prototyping of tools, canvases, and session scripts, we demonstrated that:

    <p className="text-lg mb-1">⚖️</p>
    <strong>Participation can fit developer budgets</strong>

    <strong>Simple rituals lower the barrier</strong>

## What it taught me

This project fundamentally shaped how I think about design in systems where power is unequal and stakes are deeply personal.

    <strong>Design for the system, not just the user</strong>

Mesa Te Club is the project that made me realize design isn't always about screens, flows, or interfaces. Sometimes the most powerful design tool is a table, a pot of tea, and the courage to let people shape what's theirs.
