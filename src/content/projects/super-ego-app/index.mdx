## Overview

Have you ever opened your phone to check the weather and, twenty minutes later, found yourself deep in Instagram with no memory of the detour? That gap between what we *intend* to do and what we *actually* do is what this project is about.

YOU (SuperEgo) is an assistant that doesn't live inside an app. It lives inside the operating system itself, watching the quiet signals we don't notice, for example how fast we switch between apps, how late we're still scrolling. It pairs those signals with a gentle understanding of how emotionally self-aware each person is, then nudges accordingly (sometimes with friction, sometimes with a reflective question that stops you mid-scroll).

> _I led the research synthesis, behavioral framing, system logic, and interaction design, and built the hi-fi prototype._

## The question that started it all

I kept coming back to something that bothered me. Every productivity app I'd tried assumed I was a rational planner who just needed a better to-do list. But the real problem was never the list, it was the **autopilot**.

When I dug into research, four patterns kept showing up:

<section className="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-3 my-8 not-prose">
  <article className="bg-muted rounded-2xl p-5 border border-border/10">
    <p className="text-2xl mb-1">🫥</p>
    <strong className="block">Invisible drift</strong>
    <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mt-1 leading-relaxed">People feel disorganized, but the real issue is they don't notice when they drift off course.</p>

    <strong className="block">Autopilot habits</strong>
    <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mt-1 leading-relaxed">Habits are rigid and run on autopilot and by the time you catch yourself, the moment has passed.</p>

    <strong className="block">Emotions ignored</strong>
    <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mt-1 leading-relaxed">Most tools completely ignore your emotional state, as if stress and mood don't shape every decision.</p>

    <p className="text-2xl mb-1">✋🏽</p>
    <strong className="block">Intention vs. Action gap</strong>
    <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mt-1 leading-relaxed">There's a gap between what people plan to do and what their hands actually do on the phone.</p>
  </article>
</section>

All of this pointed to one question:

> What if your phone could notice you drifting before you do and gently bring you back, without taking away your freedom to choose?

## How I got there

### 1. Starting with what I assumed (and what the research said back)

Before sketching anything, I wrote down every assumption I was carrying. Then I went looking for evidence to prove myself wrong.

<section className="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-3 my-6 not-prose">
  <article className="bg-muted rounded-xl p-5 border border-border/10">
    <strong>🎯 Own your goals</strong>
    <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mt-1 leading-relaxed">People do better when they choose their direction, not when an app tells them what to fix.</p>

  <article className="bg-muted rounded-xl p-5 border border-border/10">
    <strong>🪜 Small backup actions</strong>
    <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mt-1 leading-relaxed">After failure, "get back on track" doesn't help. A walk instead of the gym does.</p>

  <article className="bg-muted rounded-xl p-5 border border-border/10">

    <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mt-1 leading-relaxed">Nobody journals for ten minutes. But they'll answer one specific prompt about how they feel.</p>

### 2. Designing the loop — how YOU actually works

The core is a four-step loop -> figure out where you are, understand your emotions, set the rules for how the system speaks up, and mirror back what it learned. This keeps repeating and getting smarter each time. Each cycle tightens the fit between what you want and what you actually do.

### 3. Two people I designed for

I stress-tested the system with two very different fictional lives:

<section className="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-3 my-6 not-prose">
  <article className="bg-muted rounded-xl p-5 border border-border/10">
    <p className="text-lg mb-1">👩🏻‍💻</p>
    <strong>Grace, 30, Analyst</strong>
    <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mt-1 leading-relaxed">Motivated by mastery. Cares about <em>too many things</em> and ends up scattered. Wants to protect deep work and family time and stop feeling guilty about what she didn't finish.</p>
  </article>
  <article className="bg-muted rounded-xl p-5 border border-border/10">
    <p className="text-lg mb-1">👨🏽‍🎓</p>
    <strong>Phil, 24, CS Student</strong>
    <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mt-1 leading-relaxed">Driven by connection, vulnerable to comparison. Opens social media to feel connected, closes it feeling worse. Wants to understand his emotional patterns, not suppress them.</p>
  </article>
</section>

## What I designed

### The big idea: your phone's quiet conscience

Think of Freud's SuperEgo concept. Not as a strict parent, but as a thoughtful inner voice that notices when you're on autopilot. That's YOU. It doesn't live in an app you have to remember to open. It lives at the OS level, present in the background, watching patterns (never content), and stepping in at the moments that matter.

<ProjectImageAsset src="super-ego-app/integration.jpg" alt="Screenshot: System overview - data inputs, emotional awareness, interventions" />

### Onboarding that feels like a conversation

Most apps dump you into a settings screen. YOU starts with a conversation. Pick a goal, but only one. Try to pick three? YOU gently explains that focus works better than ambition. Not sure? Tap "Help me decide" and YOU observes your patterns for a week before suggesting anything.

Then choose your role for the system — how much do you want it to speak up? At the end, it summarizes everything: your goal, what YOU will watch for, how it'll intervene, and exactly how to change any of it.

<ProjectImageAsset src="super-ego-app/onboarding.jpg" alt="Screenshot: Goal selection and 'Help me decide' flow" />

### Getting to know your emotional landscape

Inspired by the **LEAS framework**, I created short "Help me understand you" exercises. You read a social scenario, answer how you'd feel and how the other person might feel, then rate a few statements about how easily you process emotions.

Based on responses, YOU calibrates everything. <br/> 
**High emotional awareness → nuanced, layered prompts**. <br/>
**Still building that vocabulary → simpler, warmer ones.**

### Two kinds of nudges for two kinds of minds

Here's where dual-process theory comes alive. Each persona gets a subtle nudge (System 1) and a reflective moment (System 2):

<aside className="bg-muted rounded-xl p-5 border border-border/10 not-prose my-6">
  <strong>👩🏻‍💻 Grace — Protecting focus</strong>
  <div className="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-4 mt-2">
    <div>
      <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground"><strong>Subtle nudge:</strong> During focus blocks, low-value apps don't disappear, they just slow down. A small delay, a gentle message: <em>"This is your high-value time."</em></p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground"><strong>Reflective moment:</strong> If she keeps drifting, YOU asks: <em>"Your focus blocks haven't been working. Want to adjust when they happen?"</em> Micro-changes, not lectures.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</aside>

<ProjectImageAsset src="super-ego-app/system2-grace.jpg" alt="Screenshot: System 2 intervention - reflective dialog after drift" />

<aside className="bg-muted rounded-xl p-5 border border-border/10 not-prose my-6">
  <strong>👨🏽‍🎓 Phil — Understanding stress</strong>
  <div className="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-4 mt-2">
    <div>
      <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground"><strong>Subtle nudge:</strong> When stress patterns appear, such as fast typing, rapid switching, a gentle haptic pulse mimics slow breathing. No notification. Just a rhythm in your hand.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground"><strong>Reflective moment:</strong> Pick from emotion categories, tag what's contributing, write a note to "Future Phil." When the pattern recurs, YOU resurfaces it. A letter from your past self.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</aside>

<ProjectImageAsset src="super-ego-app/system1-phil.jpg" alt="Screenshot: System 1 intervention - haptic cue for calm breathing" />
<ProjectImageAsset src="super-ego-app/system2-phil.jpg" alt="Screenshot: System 2 intervention - emotional check-in and note to Future Phil" />

### When the system should step back

YOU isn't a therapist. If Phil's stress stays high for days, it doesn't double down — it reframes: *"Maybe the goal right now isn't to lower stress. It's to understand it."*. And gently asking, *"Would it help to talk to someone who isn't an app?"*

Users can always adjust their level, pause goals without losing progress, or change direction.

## What came out of it

A high-fidelity prototype and a system I was proud of believing in:

## What it taught me

This project changed how I think — not just about design, but about people.

<section className="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-3 my-6 not-prose">
  <article className="bg-muted rounded-xl p-5 border border-border/10">
    <p className="text-lg mb-1">📝</p>
    <strong>Write down beliefs first</strong>
    <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mt-1 leading-relaxed">I listed every assumption about behavior, motivation, and data. Half were wrong. The right ones became the system's foundation.</p>
  </article>
  <article className="bg-muted rounded-xl p-5 border border-border/10">
    <p className="text-lg mb-1">👻</p>
    <strong>Invisible stuff matters most</strong>
    <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mt-1 leading-relaxed">A two-second delay. A vibration matching breathing. These "invisible" moments shaped behavior more than any screen I designed.</p>
  </article>
  <article className="bg-muted rounded-xl p-5 border border-border/10">
    <p className="text-lg mb-1">🎭</p>
    <strong>People feel differently — literally</strong>
    <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mt-1 leading-relaxed">Some name twelve feelings in a moment; others genuinely experience "fine" or "not fine." Ignor this and you can really miss out on an experience that adapts to users.</p>
  </article>
  <article className="bg-muted rounded-xl p-5 border border-border/10">
    <p className="text-lg mb-1">🤲</p>
    <strong>Never take control away</strong>
    <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mt-1 leading-relaxed">From choosing your goal to choosing how loudly the system speaks — autonomy wasn built-in.</p>
  </article>
</section>

YOU is the project that made me believe technology can do more than track and remind. It can notice the preconscious, the drift and ask: *"Is this what you wanted to be doing right now?"*
